# AI-Driven-Tangram-Generator-
Develops an AI model that interprets words and translates them into Tangram shapes. User-friendly interface allowing for easy input and visualization. Handles a diverse set of words, creating accurate and recognizable shapes. Efficient system with quick processing and response times.
And this repo contains a file which uses APIs instead of datasets and that file contains code in which I am developed the code for neural network specifically useful for tangram generator.(you can view the code if you want and suggest me, if there are any other ways I can develop).
